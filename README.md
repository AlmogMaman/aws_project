This project utilizes the following AWS services:
- **EC2**: For hosting the web application.
- **S3**: For storing user-uploaded files.
- **RDS**: For relational database management.
- **CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging.

## Technologies Used

- AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, CloudWatch)
- Node.js
- Express
- React
- MongoDB (or your choice of database)
- Docker (if applicable)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- AWS CLI

## Deployment

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image (if applicable):
   \`\`\`bash
   docker build -t my-app .
   \`\`\`

2. Push the image to ECR (Elastic Container Registry) or deploy directly to EC2.

3. Set up your RDS instance via the AWS Management Console and configure your environment variables.

4. Upload any necessary static files to S3.

5. Launch the application on EC2 and configure the necessary security groups and IAM roles.

## Usage

After deployment, you can access the application at:
\`\`\`
http://your-ec2-instance-public-ip
\`\`\`

To log in, use the credentials set up during the registration process.
